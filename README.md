# scrum_helper

Script, that will find the most efficient set of tasks to be taken from the
pool of groomed tasks.

## Execution

The script takes two arguments (first: a path to csv with the following columns: task_id, story_points, KSP; second: velocity of the team) and it prints (writes to STDOUT).
Example:
```
sprint-planning-helper.py csv_with_tasks.csv 13
```
